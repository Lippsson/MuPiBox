# The folders of 5.1 below ~/.mupibox (see mupi_paths.sh): server/ (the program), player/, data/ (what the box keeps)
# and cache/. Before, program, data and cache were mixed in Sonos-Kids-Controller-master and spotifycontroller-main -
# and every update had to save the data, replace the program and put the data back, its most delicate step.
#
# Moves a box over, or makes the folders and links a box of 5.1 needs (after a fresh installation; after an update put a
# new server/ in place). It can run as often as it is started: what is in place stays. What an older program wrote at a
# place of before is taken over - when the new place has one too, the newer of the two stays there and the other one is
# kept in data/kept-<time>/ (nothing is deleted). That way a box that went back to a version before 5.1 (its update
# installs it into Sonos-Kids-Controller-master again) comes back whole with the next update.
#
# The names of before stay as links, so an older program, a script or a command typed from the Discord still finds
# everything: Sonos-Kids-Controller-master -> server, spotifycontroller-main -> player; in the program's folder
# server/config -> data/library (with the program's own config.json, monitor.json, network.json and wlan.json linked into
# it), www/cover -> data/covers, www/rss-covers -> cache/rss-covers, cache -> ~/.mupibox/cache; the logs, the app's
# sessions, the hidden covers, the NAS folder index, thumbs/ and the play time of the day at their places of before.
# The links in the program's folder name their target by its full path: the update of a version before 5.1 copies
# server/config and www/cover as they are (cp -a, the link itself) into a backup folder elsewhere - a relative link
# pointed to nothing there, and that update stopped ("data.json backup failed").
#
# A step that fails takes back all of this run (last first): the box is as it was, and the caller - the update - stops
# before it touches anything. A run cut off (a power cut) leaves .layout-moving behind: the next start finishes it
# (restore_interrupted_update.sh, before pm2 starts the programs), as does the next run.
#
# Runs as root. The app's server and the player are stopped meanwhile and started again after (NO_PM2=1: the caller has
# stopped them - the update), the scripts that write the library waited for and its locks taken (as the backend takes
# them, see restore_interrupted_update.sh). For a test on a copy: MUPI_HOME=<copy>, NO_PM2=1, LOCK_DIR=<dir>,
# LAYOUT_OWNER=<user:group>, FAIL_AT=<step> (fails there, to see the way back).
