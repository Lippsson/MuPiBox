# Since 5.1 there is no previous admin interface (PHP pages behind lighttpd) any more: the app does everything it did.
# The update takes it off a box that had it (on or switched off in the app since 5.0.12) - run as root, as often as it
# is started:
#   - php-fpm stopped and disabled, lighttpd's PHP module out, the PHP packages removed (DietPi's software 89, so
#     dietpi-software knows; when that fails, the packages stay - nothing runs them)
#   - its files in /var/www gone; /var/www/cover stays (the covers of the radio stations, see covers.ts)
#   - what the switch of 5.0.12 left (legacy_admin.sh and its files, the PHP security update's mark)
#   - the web server's right to run anything as root (sudoers.d/www-data): only the PHP pages used it, and through it
#     a flaw in lighttpd would have reached root
# lighttpd stays: it serves the app on port 80/443 with the box's certificate. That no .php address answers with PHP and
# the Spotify login of a box set up before the app (https://<box>/spotify.php) goes on to the app's callback is
# config/lighttpd/92-mupibox-no-php.conf, which the update puts in place before. lighttpd is not restarted here: the
# update does that after. --keep-packages: all of it but the PHP packages (at the start, after an update cut off here -
# removing them takes too long then; the next update does it).
# A box of 5.1 that goes back to a version before gets PHP back from the update (older_web_server).
