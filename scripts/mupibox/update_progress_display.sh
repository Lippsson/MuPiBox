# The progress of an update on the display: $1 = percent, $2 = the step as the update script names it (its whiptail
# lines, English). Called by the app's update for every step (backend-api app-api/updates.ts: the stand-in for whiptail
# and run.sh) - in the background, it never holds the update up. The step becomes one of a few parts with a sentence in
# the box's language (prepare, download, packages, install, settings, done, failed); the maintenance picture is drawn
# with the bar (maintenance_screen.sh update <percent> <part>).
#
# The newest state wins: every call says what is to be shown (want), then whoever has the lock draws what was said
# last - a step that comes while a picture is being drawn is not lost (a fast step before a long one stood there for
# the whole long one). At most a picture every 2 seconds; the end at once.
#
# An abort is shown only when the box stays stopped after it (/tmp/mupibox-update-nostart: the way back is not
# complete, the box has to be restarted). After any other abort the update starts the display again by itself - a
# picture drawn then would only flash while the display starts.
