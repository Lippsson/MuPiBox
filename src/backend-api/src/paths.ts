 * Where the box keeps its program, its data and its cache - the one place for these paths in the server.
 *
 * Since 5.1 everything lies below ~/.mupibox in four folders (scripts/mupibox/migrate_layout.sh moves a box over;
 * before, program, data and cache were mixed in Sonos-Kids-Controller-master and spotifycontroller-main, which stay
 * as links to server/ and player/):
 *   server/   the program - an update replaces it; its config/ holds what the box writes for it (config.json,
 *             monitor.json, network.json, wlan.json)
 *   player/   the player - an update replaces it
 *   data/     what the box keeps - an update never touches it: library/ (data.json, resume.json, the offline lists,
 *             the episode positions ...), covers/ (of the local albums), logs/, the app's sessions, the hidden covers,
 *             the NAS folder index, the play time of the day
 *   cache/    what can be fetched or made again - may be emptied at any time
 * In development and the tests everything lies below the working directory, as before: config/ and cache/.
